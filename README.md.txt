Brownian Motion Simulation
This project simulates Brownian Motion, the random movement of a particle over time. The motion is modeled as a random walk in 1D or 2D, and the results are visualized using Python.

How It Works
The particle starts at a fixed position.
At each step, the particle moves randomly in one or more directions.
The trajectory is plotted to visualize the motion.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries: matplotlib, random

Customization
You can modify the following:

Number of Steps: Change how many random movements the particle makes.
Dimensions: Switch between 1D or 2D motion.
Step Size: Adjust how far the particle moves at each step.
Output
The program generates a plot showing the particle's trajectory. In 1D, it shows position vs. step number, and in 2D, it shows the particle's path on a plane.
